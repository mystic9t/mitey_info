1. Startup Idea & Problem
🚀 Startup Idea: LocalGovAssist – AI-Powered Government Scheme Navigator & Civic Support 
​

🧠 Problem (Validated by Reddit + real Indian challenges) 
​

Millions of Indians don’t know which government benefits/schemes they’re eligible for due to complexity, literacy, and language diversity. 
​

Discussions from Indian developer & startup communities show a trust gap with tech, not a tech gap — tools have to be familiar, simple, and localized. 
​

Redditors frequently complain about bureaucratic hurdles, lack of guidance on public services, and opaque processes. (This is a well-known community gripe even if not directly cited here.) 
​

👉 This means millions of people are underserved, especially in Tier-2/3 cities and rural India. 
​
